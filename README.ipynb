Individuals and institutions can invest in the loans and earn attractive returns. Prosper handles all loan servicing on behalf of the matched borrowers and investors.*\"<br>\n",

For example, on the map I used a color scale where the states more red had higher interest rates, and more green had lower rates. The plots below the map in the dashboard used the same colors to highlight the top/bottom 10 state interest rates. Where applicable (including in the prior example), I clarified the color meanings with a legend. <br>\n",
